## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates the price of a car given its characteristics. The project involves:
- Data collection and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Building and evaluating machine learning models

This repository contains all code, datasets (or instructions on how to obtain them), and documentation to reproduce the results.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and insights on car price distributions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and transforming existing ones.
- **Model Building:** Training various regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- **Evaluation:** Using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.
